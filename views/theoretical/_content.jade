  ## A cryptocurrency system

  uCoin uses the crypto-currency concept introduced by Bitcoin, which is to use cryptography features such as *signature* to create digital currencies. uCoin fits in this definition, however it has completely different fundation principles than Bitcoin like individuals, Web of Trust and Universal Dividend to do *really* better than Bitcoin.

  Actually, uCoin has a theoretical reference called [Relative Money Theory (french)](http://wiki.creationmonetaire.info/). This theory **demonstrates** that a currency which aims at respecting individual's economic liberties MUST implement the Universal Dividend (aka. *Basic Income*), which is the only way to avoid both spatial and temporal asymmetry toward money issuance.

  ## A spate-time asymmetry

  Spate-time asymmetry refers to the relative access of individuals to newly created money. Concretely, all existing currencies (2014) are both spatially and temporally asymmetrical for their users. Let's take Bitcoin example to understand why.

  ### Spatially

  When new Bitcoins are created, *only some Bitcoin users* (the miners) are credited of brand new Bitcoins, while the others get nothing. **We believe this is the first injustice.**

  However, some might say:
.ui.message « but miners used their electricity and time to get it! »

  ... we would answer this work *shouldn't have been rewarded by newly created Bitcoins*. New Bitcoins should spread the whole Bitcoin community. Miners should be rewared another way, not by money issuance.

  Of course, Bitcoin can't create money through Basic Income since Bitcoin users are not strongly identified, and one might benefit multiple times of money creation if he owned several wallets. uCoin get rid of this problem in its conception by identifying its users and giving *the same amount to everyone*.

  ### Temporally

  Bitcoin has a planned limit of 21 million BTC, which means less and less bitcoins will be created over the time until 0 remains. So, once first adopters will have mined every bitcoin, how will future joiners do to get bitcoins? Answer is: just like Euros or Dollars. To get money you have to work for the ones who already own it. **We believe this is the second injustice.**

  Every member of a monetary community should be equal towards money issuance, and get the same relative amount of new money over the time, *even if he is a later adopter*.

  uCoin aims at fixing this bug too by making Universal Dividend *grow by the time* according to precise rules allowing members equality toward money issuance on a half-lifetime.

  ## A solution

  The whole idea is to create a monetary community composed of strongly identified members, and regularly create new money to their benefit through *Universal Dividend*.

  This is made possible through Web of Trust concept introduced by OpenPGP format, which allows people to trust each others' identity and be confident enough that a public key represents a unique and living individual.

  uCoin however won't use OpenPGP for its cryptographic features: Elliptic Curves will be used instead for the conciseness of its generated keys and the pratical advantages it results from. This involves for us to specify our own Web of Trust mechanisms, but we think it worths the pain.

  ### Blockchain & WoT

  #### Web of Trust
  The Web of Trust is to be written in a common document: the blockchain. Yes, blockchain like in Bitcoin's blockchain. This document is a *space-time referential*, where *space* is represented by individuals and *time* by a blockchain unit: a block.

  So within a block, we both have *time* information (*t*) and a flow of individuals (*di*). From this definition, we can simply deduce the community(t) (*a.k.a.* wot(t)) which is the sum of the community variations *di(t)* in the `[0,t]` interval. Another way to say it is: wot(t) represents the community at a *t* instant.

  #### Transactions
  But that's not all: blockchain is also the place where *transactions*, the support of money, are sequentially stored and allow to define money ownership.

  For this part, uCoin really looks like Bitcoin: transactions take inputs (*a.k.a.* sources) and generate outputs. However, in uCoin inputs may be:

  * another transaction [Bitcoin like]
  * a block's validation reward (free transaction fees) [Bitcoin like]
  * a block's Universal Dividend [uCoin specific]

  As you can see, no *generation transaction* exists in uCoin. This kind of transaction is replaced by *Universal Dividend transactions*.

  Outputs, on their side, are always public keys (not necessarily members).

  ##### Block content
  So for a given block, we may have the following informations:

  * Public keys, and their attached identity
  * Certifications of identities by other public keys
  * Membership requests for people to opt-in/opt-out
  * Excluded members' public key
  * Transactions emitted by users

  ##### Proof of Work

  Like any P2P crypto-currency system, uCoin has a way to synchronize its peers for writing its common document (the blockchain). However, uCoin's benefiting from a really different environment than other altcoins: **an identified Web of Trust**.

  This little difference has a tremendous impact: while Bitcoin has to make a **global trial** using CPU resource to avoid blockchain's hijacking by few people, uCoin has the possibility to rely on its members to write the blockchain: this allows us to both avoids the energy wasting problem introduced by PoW & easily sweep away the 51% attack in uCoin.

  Concretely, uCoin has a **personalized trial** for each of its members that is getting harder for the member who succeeds writing a block, while it is getting easier - until a given floor - for the others. This mechanism ensures a rotation in the blockchain's writing, while keeping the advantage of PoW for synchronizing the peers.

  > It can be noted too that, since a block does not provide extra money creation, members won't be pushed into competing for writing next block. Still, transactions fees may produce this effect, but in a certainly lower order of magnitude than in Bitcoin's mining.

  ### To summarize
  uCoin's blockchain can be compared to Bitcoin's blockchain: a great book tracing the history of each membership inside the Community along with the transactions of its users. With the blockchain, we have the **fundamental referential** of the [Relative Money Theory](http://wiki.creationmonetaire.info/) (humans), and the flow of transactions emitted by the currency users.

  ## A free economy
  The goal of all this is to allow people to participate to a *free economy* thanks to a *free currency*. What is a free economy? [Relative Money Theory (french)](http://wiki.creationmonetaire.info/) defines it through 4 economic freedoms:

  * **The freedom to choose your currency system**: because money should not be imposed
  * **The freedom to access resources**: because we *all* should have access to economic & monetary resources
  * **The freedom to estimate & produce value**: because value is a purely relative to each individual, in space and time
  * **The freedom to trade with the money**: because we should not be limited by the avaible money supply

  Those 4 economic freedoms should be understood together, not exclusively. Plus, *"freedom"* has to be understood as "*non-nuisance*". So here, *freedom* does not mean the right to take all of a resource (like water source in a desert) so no more is available to the others.

  Now you get it, this is the goal: *free economy through free currency.*
