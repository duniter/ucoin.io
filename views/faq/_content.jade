  ## General aspects

  ### uCoin in 3 words?
  Free Currency System.

  ### Free currency?
  This is a new word, as no free currency existed before: free currency is one [respecting 4 economical freedoms](/theoretical/#a-free-economy), and leading to apply *Universal Dividend* to its members.

  ### Universal Dividend?
  This is a special case of [Basic Income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income): an amount every individual receives on a regular basis (monthly, annualy, ...) without other condition than being a unique living member of the Community.

  **This is not a redistribution system**. This is a *currency system* where money is directly issued *by* individuals and *to* individuals.

  ### How to achieve this?
  uCoin uses cryptography features provided by [Ed25519](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) scheme to both:
  * Identify unique & living individuals (a.k.a *members* of the monetary community)
  * Allow money transfers through digital signatures

  ### So, uCoin is not like Bitcoin?
  Well, uCoin is a *[cryptocurrency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency)* system and so is Bitcoin. Plus, both systems use [Proof of Work](#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) (PoW). But uCoin takes advantage of [Web of Trust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust) mechanisms for both applying *Universal Dividend* and considerably save energy power compared to Bitcoin.

  ### Still using Proof of Work?
  yes, PoW is still here. But in a largely lower order of magnitude. *Really*.

  ### What is a Web of Trust?
  Web of Trust refers to a data structure allowing people to trust each others' identity. In uCoin, it is exactly the same.

  ## The protocol

  ### So, how does it work?
  A *Blockchain*, a common document shared by all the peers of a network, is being regularly updated by specific peers to defined who are the members of the community, how much money exists and who are the owners of it.

  ### Waiting for data updates?
  Yes: keychain is built up using *OpenPGP keys*, *signatures* and *memberships*. Mix all this data to make a coherent mixture, and tada! You have made a *keyblock*, a block of keychain.

  ### And what is done with keyblocks?
  Keyblocks are stacked, together, sequentially. And this makes a keychain.

  ### Why this name "keychain"?
  The pillar data of uCoin is a chain of *digital keys*, an history of them. That is why. Keychain is a kind of *Decentralized Identification System*.

  ### Who can participate to write the next keyblock?
  In uCoin, *only members of the Community are able to contribute to the writing of the next keyblock*. This is one of deepest protocol rules.

  Also note that **no possible ambiguity exits about who are the members and what is their key**: public keys are directly written in the keychain, not only their fingerprint. This is done for security reasons to avoid key forging matching the same key fingerprint. No ambiguity, no cheating.

  ### Do every member has to participate writing the next keyblock?
  No, it is every single member's choice.

  ### How is chosen the member who will write the next block?
  The member is not chosen, any member may write it. This a "competition" where the first member who succeed in generating a valid block who writes it.

  ### Isn't there a risk a single member always succeed in proposing a valid block before others?
  Yes, that's why when a member succeed to propose a block, his next blocks will require an harder work to be accepted. If he does not succeed for a while, the next blocks will be easier. And so on.

  ### Is there a reward for this work?
  No reward at all.

  ### Why would members do this if there is no reward?
  Why wouldn't they? If they are in such a currency system, it should be *precisely* for the global benefits of using a free currency: free economy. Furthermore, a stuck keychain means no Universal Dividend at all for anyone, including them.

  ### Isn't this a painful process?
  This is a completely automated process, members just have to enable it in their software. Nothing to do manually (even if possible).

  ### How is decided the UD amount?
  The amount is currency specific. But a general rule is defined in uCoin protocol:

      UD(t+1) = MAX(UD(t) ; c * M(t) / N(t+1) )

  The value of the parameters `c`, `UD(0)` and `dt` are to be chosen by the implementation currency. For example, it could be:

      c = 0.0036815
      UD(0) = 100
      dt ~= 2 weeks

  to lead to a 9.22% annual « c », but issued through 2 weeks chunks.

.ui.info.message
  | Note: 9.22% annual « c » is a central symmetry between generations of 80 years life expectancy members. Those results may be found in the

  ### How to know a member received the UD?
  If he was a member at that moment, he *did* receive it. This is just an accepted rule.

  ### How to know an individual is a member?
  At a *t* instant, an individual is a member if his public key's fingerprint last occurrence *before or at t* in the keychain was `+`.
  If the last occurrence is `-` or not found, then the individual was not a member at *t*.

  ### How to identify the coins created with the UD?
  This technical detail is described in the [protocol](/specs), but to summarize: coins' values depends on the UD amount, and each coin has a CoinID whose format is:

      AMENDMENT_HASH:AMENDMENT_NUMBER:COIN_NUMBER

  for example:

      61AB4547159CB33042211058AE12126BEB444AB3:504:3

  If you looked at amendment `#504-61AB4547159CB33042211058AE12126BEB444AB3` (if it existed), you could deduce the value of this coin since a rule gives it to you.

  ### How nodes will decide which keys to add to the keychain?
  First, a key must have [udid2](https://github.com/Open-UDC/open-udc/blob/master/docs/OpenUDC_Authentication_Mechanisms.draft.txt#L164) format UserID in its OpenPGP key, and have sufficient signatures (in both quantity & quality) from existing members in the Community.
  Second, the owner of the key have to make a request to the network *expressing its will* to join the Community.

  With those 2 prerequisties, a uCoin node is able to add a key in the keychain.

  > N.B. 1: 'sufficient' will be clearly detailed in the protocol, but is not exactly known yet

  > N.B. 2: a key added to the keychain which *no more* fits the signatures' requirements will automatically be excluded from the Community

  ## Server software

  ### Which OS are supported?
  At the moment, only GNU/Linux and MacOS X are supported, however the software should also work on Windows (but harder to install because of external dependencies).

  For now, Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 have been tested. But any recent GNU/Linux distribution should be able to do the job.

  ### Which softwares are required?
  uCoin relies on some external softwares, listed here:
  * MongoDB
  * Node + NPM
  * GnuPG

  ### How to install uCoin?
  Follow [Install](/install) guide.

  ### Do you plan to have a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installation?
  Yes we do.

  ### Are there prerequisties before running?
  Two cases here:
  * for a *passive* server (useful to store your transactions): a OpenPGP is required (no particular key)
  * for an *active* server (writing in the keychain): **a member OpenPGP key** is required

  ## Getting involved

  ### How may I help?
  You can help on project developement in many ways, depending your available time, energy and your profile.

  Please read below requirements and possibilities. If you feel comfortable with one these profiles, do not hesitate to [contact us at admin@ucoin.io](mailto:admin@ucoin.io).

  #### As a backend developer
  You may participate to uCoin server's development, which is the core software implementing UCP. You will need some technical skills:
  * Node.js development, lot of asynchronous JavaScript
  * MongoDB database, trough Mongoose module
  * OpenPGP format, through [openpgpjs](http://openpgpjs.org/)

  If you are not affraid by those technologies, you can both start reading [HTTP API](https://github.com/ucoin-io/ucoin/blob/master/doc/HTTP_API.md) and [contact us](mailto:admin@ucoin.io).

  #### As a designer/frontend developer
  See this beautiful website? You want to improve it with new content, new design? Feel free to propose your skills, any help is welcome.

  What probably uCoin needs the most is: **a logo**!

  #### As a mathematician
  uCoin protocol will use Graph Theory properties to build a Web of Trust of unique & living individuals. Even if uCoin team is made up of engineers/PhDs, Graph Theory is not something easy and we probably need experts in that domain.

  So, if Graph Theory is your every day life, **do not hesitate to come to us!**

  #### As a preacher
  Well, here, you do not need us to do the job: speak about uCoin, make articles, share links, knowledge, experiences, whatever! No need to ask, simply do it!

  ### What to learn first?
  Well, if reached this paragraph reading the whole FAQ, you should have a rather good idea of what is uCoin. You could go deeper with [Theoretical section](/theoretical). From there, you should be able to talk about the project with a minimum of background.

  If you want to get deeper in uCoin, read [UCP](/specs), this is uCoin protocol. All what you need to know about technical IT stuff is there, even if not in a tutorial format.

  Last, you could try to read [RMT](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9orie_relative_de_la_monnaie), which is the fundamental theory behind uCoin's way of creating new money.

  ### The best way to stay tuned?
  [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=fr#!forum/ucoin) for major events, [uCoin Forum](http://forum.ucoin.io) for every day talking about development, events, questions & almost every subject. Last, you could join the chatroom with the bottom-right *Chat* icon visible on each page of this website.
